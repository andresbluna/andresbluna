## 📖 About Me

I'm a coding enthusiast who loves tech. Always ready for a good challenge or a fun project. At the moment, I'm diving deep into learning new languages and tools—because why not? 🎯

## 🛠️ What I Do

- **Languages**: Java, Python, and JavaScript are my go-tos, but I'm always ready to pick up something new. 🌐

- **Methodology**: Agile? Check. Scrum? Got it. Kanban? Why not? I love working in teams and getting things done efficiently. 🔄
